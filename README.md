# HD-seniorProject
This is my final project for my senior year at Hanover College!

"Ugly Wallpaper"

The software I will use for this project are Xcode.
Programming language is Swift 5

Motivation:

- Right now, there are few to none applications that change your wallpaper for you. The process to change your wallpapers for macOS and Windows has you take multiple steps within the system settings. These processes contain at least 6 to 7 steps in order to successfully change the wallpaper. Also, if you want your pictures to cycle through so your backgrounds change automatically; First you have to download all the images you want to include inside your slideshow. Secondly, you have to store that group of images inside a folder on your computerâ€™s hard drive. Lastly to get those photos to cycle through as your background image you have to set that specific folder as the file location to where the system pulls the images for the background. My application eliminates all those other steps, and just pulls the photos from unsplash.


The goal of this project was to be a simple desktop application for the macOS operating system. The applications consists of a textfield,that 
allows the user to type in a keyword which will then go and get a picture from a online API. The picture is chosen based on the keyword, you can
enter in multiple keywords, you just have to separate the words by a comma. Another feature I have is the wallpapers can change based on a timer. Right
now I have a set time set for the timer. What I'm working on now is having a user set a preference for a timer using a drop down menu, with optional choices.
The wallpapers also condsidered the size of your monitor or laptop screen size, so it gives the clearest images. This application allows
for a quicker and more efficient process than the default way to do it on macOS now. You also have a greater variety of photos using 
my application then, finding photos on the internet.
